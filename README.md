# Simon Louie's CS 450 Final Project

This is an archive of my final project for CS 450 Introduction to Computer Graphics at Oregon State University.  
Here is a demo of the project: https://media.oregonstate.edu/media/t/1_hc2pg8sw

## About the Project

I created a tiny game inspired by Space Invader, called Space Defender. I later discovered it is an oddly popular name.  
The game uses OpenGL and FreeGLUT for the visuals. I built the game using C++ over the course of about three days.

## About the Game

The player controls a spaceship. The objective is to shoot down enemy spaceships.  
The player gains 100 points when an enemy spaceship gets shot down.  
The player loses 200 points if the player's spaceship gets hit.
